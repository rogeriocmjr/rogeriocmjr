Graduated in Informatics for Business from the Faculty of Technology of SÃ£o Bernardo do Campo. Python developer, with knowledge in NiFi, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes and Linux (bash).

Currently, starting a MBA in Data Science and Analytics at USP/Esalq and studying Spark (Databricks with GCP integration) and DevOps (Azure DevOps and AWS DevOps environment).
I work in a generalist way and I'm specializing in Python.
My last role was as a GCP Data Engineer, participating in lift-and-shit (system transcription from one cloud to another) and on-premise (data extraction from a local server, processing and storage and application in the cloud) projects.
My main goals for this year are focused on improving tools such as cloud, big data and devops, with a focus on Python. Going to an English-speaking country to have direct and immersive contact with the language would be a medium or short-term goal, for personal and professional improvement.
